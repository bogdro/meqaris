This is the README file for Meqaris.

Meqaris (Meeting Equipment and Room Invitation System) is software that
 allows booking meeting rooms and other resources (like mobile whiteboards,
 projectors or conference sets) using the same e-mail invitations that
 are used to invite participants to meetings.

Meqaris allows to:

- register meeting resources, like rooms or equipment,
- send invitations to the resources (requires mail server support),
- receive positive and negative replies.

Requirements:

- a system with Perl (https://www.perl.org/) installed, along with the
  following modules (available from CPAN / https://metacpan.org/):
  * Config::Simple,
  * Data::ICal,
  * DateTime::Format::ICal,
  * DateTime::TimeZone::ICal,
  * DBD::Pg,
  * DBI,
  * Getopt::Long,
  * MIME::Base64,
  * MIME::Parser,
  with all their dependencies (the list may include but not be limited to:
  Module::Install, Test::NoWarnings, Test::LongString, Class::Accessor,
  DateTime, DateTime::TimeZone, Moo, Set::Infinite, Test::Requires,
  Class::Accessor-Chained, Class::ReturnValue, DateTime::Event::ICal,
  DateTime::Event::Recurrence, DateTime::Set, Params::Validate,
  Text::vFile::asData)

- actual mail sending requires the Net::SMTP and Net::Domain Perl modules,

- a PostgreSQL database server (https://www.postgresql.org/), version 9.2
  or newer, with the PL/pgSQL language installed.
