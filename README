This is the README file for Meqaris.

Meqaris (Meeting Equipment and Room Invitation System) is a system that
 allows booking meeting rooms and other resources (like mobile whiteboards,
 projectors or conference sets) using the same e-mail invitations that
 are used to invite participants to meetings.

Meqaris allows to:

- register meeting resources, like rooms or equipment,
- send invitations to the resources (requires mail server support),
- receive positive and negative replies.

Requirements:

- a system with Perl (https://www.perl.org/) installed, along with the
  following modules (available from CPAN / https://metacpan.org/):
  * Config::Simple,
  * Data::ICal,
  * DateTime::Format::ICal,
  * DateTime::Set,
  * DateTime::TimeZone::ICal,
  * DBD::Pg,
  * DBI,
  * Fcntl,
  * Getopt::Long,
  * Log::Log4perl,
  * MIME::Base64,
  * MIME::Parser,
  with all their dependencies (the list may include but not be limited to:
  Module::Install, Test::NoWarnings, Test::LongString, Class::Accessor,
  DateTime, DateTime::TimeZone, Moo, Set::Infinite, Test::Requires,
  Class::Accessor-Chained, Class::ReturnValue, DateTime::Event::ICal,
  DateTime::Event::Recurrence, Params::Validate, Text::vFile::asData).

  The Log::Log4perl module should be optional, but can be of great help with
  logging when problems occur.

  Actual mail sending requires the Net::SMTP and Net::Domain Perl modules,

- a PostgreSQL database server (https://www.postgresql.org/), version 9.2
  or newer, with the btree_gist extension binary file (you may need to
  install the 'contrib' package, or similar).
