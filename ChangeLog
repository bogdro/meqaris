	  Events can now be updated. Mail responses can now be piped into a
	  command instead of being sent to a mail server. Other small changes.
	  Documentation updates.

	  is already present in the database - if yes, delete the old and

	  into a command instead of being sent to a mail server.

	  now supported. Safer database calls. Greatly improved logging. New

	  the Meqaris' INI file (must be accessible before the database in
	  case of database problems). Fixed getting the organizer's e-mail.
