2023-05-15	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 2.0:
	  Added support for CalDAV servers - Meqaris now sends the accepted
	  events to and deletes the cancelled events from CalDAV servers
	  connected to the impacted resources. Added support for parameters
	  in the 'mail_command' setting. Database re-designed for better
	  support for recurring events. Database checks added for validating
	  the resources' e-mail addresses. Send responses to the meeting
	  Organizer, CC'ing the e-mail sender, who may be just forwarding.
	  Fixed checking if the command specified in 'mail_command' actually
	  ran. Added creating the btree_gist extension in the documentation
	  and scripts. Added automatic tests. Added Docker configuration
	  files. Support multiple RDATE and EXDATE values. Support deleting
	  (cancelling) events just for some attendees. Cancel all occurrences
	  of an event if STATUS=CANCELLED. Fixes when updating events.
	  Clean-up code is in one place now. Many fixes in command-line
	  processing. Exit early if input or configuration seem malformed.
	  Fixes in database upgrade code. Updates in the default configuration.
	  Many other code changes and refactoring. Updated copyright. Updates
	  in packaging. Fixes and updates in the documentation. Other small
	  changes.

	  defined just once and fix some of them. Move some common code to new
	  subroutines. Delete all old event instances when processing an
	  updating invitation. Support events in a separate table in inserting
	  and deleting. Fixed the order of processing command-line options.
	  Fixed checking parameter values for command-line options. Exit with
	  a fatal error if 'From' or 'Subject' is missing to avoid undefined
	  values later. Other small changes.
	* bin/meqaris (db_connect): Exit early and log an error if "dbtype"
	  is not defined (missing in configuration).
	* bin/meqaris (db_upgrade): Commit only on no error.
	* bin/meqaris (db_run_file): Properly handle errors when opening an

2022-05-29	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 1.4:
	  Recurring events with dates specified as periods are now supported.
	  File-based locking re-enabled and moved to the database upgrade,
	  together with a new INI setting. Event update checking improved.
	  Database connection timeout can now be set. Improvements in command
	  line processing. Updates in logs. Improvements in the build system.
	  Improvements in documentation. Other small changes.
	* bin/meqaris: Parse period values in the RDATE property, but do it
	  separately. When merged into the original set, they change each
	  element to a DateTime::Span of zero length and thus break the whole
	  set. Improved checking for duplicate events (the sequence number was
	  not mapped to a column name and it wasn't checked if the new
	  sequence number or DTSTAMP were greater than the stored ones) and
	  changed some code duplication in processing updates. Check if the
	  parser directory is defined and is a directory and fall back to /tmp
	  if not. The --update, --enable, --disable and --delete commands now
	  display an error when the resource was not found.
	* bin/meqaris (send_mail): Use more global variables instead of
	  arguments to reduce code duplication and complication.
	* config/meqaris.ini: Added a connection timeout and a lock directory.
	* bin/meqaris (db_connect): Use the connection timeout parameter from
	  the INI file, falling back to 30 seconds if missing.
	* bin/meqaris (dblock): Un-comment the locking code from the main part
	  of the code and move it to this new subroutine. Use the lock
	  directory parameter from the INI file, falling back to /tmp if
	  missing, to create the lock files. This is used during database
	  upgrade where table-based locking cannot be yet used (the tables
	  simply may not yet exist at that point). Changed the locking from
	  sleep-create file to sysopen() - much faster and more reliable.
	* config/meqaris.logrotate: Created a logrotate configuration.
	* meqaris.pod: Created a POD file for Meqaris to make a manual page
	  from.
	* Makefile: Use default directories if they are not provided on the
	  command line. Make and install a manual page during installation.
	  Install a logrotate configuration during installation. Added an
	  'uninstall' target. Added a separate variable for the list of files
	  which are dependencies and are to be distributed. Use variables
	  more.
	* meqaris.spec: Use more constants instead of hard-coding the name.
	  Added the manpage. Added the logrotate configuration.
	* manual/en/usage-admin.html: Added the new parameters: 'lock_dir'
	  and 'connect_timeout'.
	* INSTALL-Meqaris.txt, manual/en/install.html: Added the new
	  parameters: 'lock_dir' and 'connect_timeout'. Added installing and
	  uninstalling the logrotate configuration. Added installing and
	  uninstalling the documentation. Added running 'make uninstall'.
	* README, manual/en/{readme,install}.html: Added the 'Fcntl' module
	  as a dependency (it's a core module anyway).

2022-05-23	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 1.2:
	  Recurring events with an infinite number of repetitions are now
	  being rejected. Events that take no time (neither an end date/time
	  nor a duration specified) are now being rejected. Fixed missing all
	  parameters when updating a resource. Other small changes.
	* bin/meqaris: Decline events when the number of repetitions is
	  infinite. Decline anniversary-type events that take no time (neither
	  DTEND nor DURATION specified). When updating a resource, check if at
	  least one of --name, --email or --description was given. Commands
	  that modify data are now logged at INFO level and --destroy-db is
	  logged at WARN level. Renamed %cfg to %inicfg. Read the whole
	  database configuration table just once for the whole run and store
	  in %dbcfg. Display a configuration error if the Log4perl
	  configuration INI file parameter is missing.
	* manual/en/*.html: Fix the page icon.
	* manual/en/readme.html: Updated reporting errors.
	* manual/en/usage-admin.html: Fixed the link to the end-user manual.
	  Clearly write that NULL is not the same as an empty string.
	* manual/en/install.html: Clarify the installation directories.

2022-05-19	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 1.1:
	  Booking multiple resources in one invitation works correctly now.
	  Allow operating (with a warning) when the database is newer than
	  expected. Other small improvements.
	* bin/meqaris: Allow operating when the database version is greater
	  than the expected value. Improved checking for duplicate events.
	  DTSTAMP is now stored converted using its time zone (if any). Added
	  "process ID" output to the initial logger. Other small updates.
	  Display an ERROR in --status if the DBD::Pg database module is not
	  installed.
	* config/meqaris-log4perl.cfg: Added "process ID" output to logger.
	* Makefile: Removed forcing the GNU 'tar' format so that each 'tar'
	  can be used for making packages. The user manual in text format is
	  no longer distributed, in favour of the HTML version. Removed the
	  world-writeable access mode from $(DATADIR)/meqaris.
	* meqaris.spec: Added the DBD::Pg module as an RPM dependency. Removed
	  the world-writeable access mode from /var/lib/meqaris.
	* manual/en/usage-admin.html: Small updates.
	* manual/en/usage-{admin,user}.html, Meqaris-user-manual.txt: Removed
	  the warning saying that inviting multiple resources in one
	  invitation can result in invalid replies.
	* INSTALL-Meqaris.txt, README, manual/en/{readme,install}.html: Made
	  the Log::Log4perl mandatory for the time being.
	* INSTALL-Meqaris.txt, manual/en/install.html: The data directory is
	  no longer required to be world-writeable access.

2022-05-16	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 1.0:
	  Recurring events are now supported (can be booked and cancelled).
	  Invitations to many resources at the same time are now supported
	  using a temporary solution (they may give multiple responses,
	  though). Settings can now be modified using the new command line
	  options: --set and --value. Other small changes. Added an HTML
	  manual. Other documentation updates.
	* bin/meqaris: Support for recurring events using DateTime::Set.
	  Temporary solution for multiple resources in one invitation. Added

	  recurring events.
	* sql/meqaris-*.pgsql: Added the SourceForge link.
	* Makefile: Added installing documentation, requiring a new parameter.
	  Added testing for BSD tar and choosing the GNU tar format then.

	  the manual is replaced by the HTML version. Added the SourceForge
	  link.
	* INSTALL-Meqaris.txt: Added editing the main and log configuration
	  files. Added installing and uninstalling the Log4perl configuration.
	  Added installing the documentation. Added permission information.
	  Added the SourceForge link.
	* README: Removed the PL/pgSQL language requirement, because PL/pgSQL
	  is installed by default on PostgreSQL 9.0+ and Meqaris requires
	  version 9.2+ anyway. Moved DateTime::Set to the list of required
	  modules. Added the SourceForge link.

2022-05-08	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdro /AT/ users . sourceforge . net>

	* Meqaris version 0.9:
	  The "From" field of the replies now contains the resource's name.
	  It's now possible to set the directory where the mail parser keeps
	  its temporary files. Resources marked with role=NON-PARTICIPANT in
	  the invitation do not get booked. Events with no attendees are now
	  ignored. Command line actions now print and log their results.
	  Status output uses colours. Other small changes.
	* bin/meqaris: The "From" field of the replies now contains the
